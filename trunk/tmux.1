.Sh NAME
.Nm tmux
.Nd "terminal multiplexer"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tmux
.Bk -words
.Op Fl vV
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl S Ar socket-path
.Op Ar command Op Ar flags
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer; it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be
accessed and controlled from a single terminal.
.Pp
.Nm
runs as a server-client system.
A server is created automatically when necessary and holds a number of
.Em sessions ,
each of which may have a number of
.Em windows
linked to it.
Any number of
.Em clients
may connect to a session, or the server
may be controlled by issuing commands with
.Nm .
Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging.
This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
Log messages will be saved into
.Pa tmux-client-PID.log
and
.Pa tmux-server-PID.log
files in the current directory, where
.Em PID
is the pid of the server or client process.
.It Fl V
Print program version.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
By default,
.Nm
will look for a config file at ~/.tmux.conf.
.It Fl S Ar socket-path
Specify an alternative path to the server socket.
The default is
.Pa /tmp/tmux-UID ,
where
.Em UID
is the uid of the user who invoked
.Nm .
.It Ar command Op Ar flags
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
.Nm ,
and described in the following sections.
If no command and flags is specified, the
.Ic new-session
command is assumed.
.Pp
.El
.Sh QUICK START
To create a new tmux session running
.Xr vi 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new-session vi
.Pp
Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.
For new-session, this is
.Ic new :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new vi
.Pp
Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.
If there are several options, they are listed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux n
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window
$
.Ed
.Pp
Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing
.Ql ^B
(ctrl-B, known as the prefix key)
followed by the
.Ql c
key.
.Pp
Windows may be navigated with:
.Ql ^B 0
(to select window 0),
.Ql ^B 1
(to select window 1), and so on;
.Ql ^B n
to select the next window; and
.Ql ^B p
to select the previous window.
.Pp
A session may be detached using
.Ql ^B d
and reattached with:
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux attach-session
.Pp
Typing
.Ql ^B \&?
lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used
to navigate the list or
.Ql Q
to exit from it.
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a
prefix,
.Ql ^B
(ctrl-B) by default, followed by a command key.
.Pp
Some of the default key bindings include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ql d
Detach current client.
.It Ql c
Create new window.
.It Ql n
Change to next window in the current session.
.It Ql p
Change to previous window in the current session.
.It Ql l
Move to last (previously selected) window in the current session.
.It Ql \&?
List current key bindings.
.El
.Pp
A complete list may be obtained with the
.Ic list-keys
command (bound to
.Ql \&?
by default).
Key bindings may be changed with the
.Ic bind-key
and
.Ic unbind-key
commands.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
maintains a configurable history buffer for each window.
By default, up to 2000 lines are kept, this can be altered with the
.Ic history-limit
option (see the
.Ic set-option
command below).
.Sh MODES
A
.Nm
window may be in one of several modes.
The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.
The others are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em output mode
This is entered when a command which produces output, such as
.Ic list-keys ,
is executed from a key binding.
The
.Ql up ,
.Ql down ,
.Ql page-up
and
.Ql page-down
keys or
.Xr vi 1
style
.Ql j
and
.Ql k
keys may be used to scroll the output up and down.
The
.Ql q
key will exit output mode.
.It Em scroll mode
This is entered with the
.Ic scroll-mode
command (bound to
.Ql =
by default) and permits the window history buffer to be inspected.
In addition to the commands supported by output mode, the left and right arrow
keys, or
.Ql h
and
.Ql l ,
will scroll left and right.
.It Em copy mode
This permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to the
.Em paste buffer
for later insertion into another window.
The navigation keys move the cursor around the window, scrolling as necessary.
In addition,
.Ql ^A
and
.Ql ^E
(or the
.Xr vi 1
style
.Ql 0
and
.Ql $
keys) move to the start and end of the line; the space key begins a selection;
and the enter key or
.Ql ^W
copies the selection to the paste buffer and exits copy mode.
.Pp
This mode is entered with the
.Ic copy-mode
command, bound to
.Ql [
by default.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
This section contains a list of the commands supported by
.Nm .
There are some flags shared by several commands; these are:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl c Ar client-tty
Apply command to the client on the given tty.
Clients may be listed with the
.Ic list-clients
command.
.It Fl s Ar session-name
Apply command to the session named
.Ar session-name .
If it is omitted and
.Nm
is invoked from a running
.Nm
client, the session containing the client is connected to will be used;
otherwise, if only one session exists, it is chosen, or if multiple sessions
exist, an error is generated.
