.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer; it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be
accessed and controlled from a single terminal.
.Pp
.Nm
runs as a server-client system. A server is created automatically when
necessary and holds a number of
.Em sessions ,
each of which may have a number of
.Em windows
connected to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session, or the server
may be controlled by issuing commands with the
.Nm
binary. Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl S Ar socket-path
This specifies an alternative path to the server socket.
The default is
.Pa /tmp/tmux-UID ,
where
.Em UID
is the uid of the user who invoked
.Nm .
.It Fl s Ar session-name
Apply command to the session named
.Ar session-name .
This option does not apply to all commands.
If it is omitted and
.Nm
is invoked from a running
.Nm
client, the session the containing client is connected to will be used;
otherwise, if only one session exists, it is chosen, or if multiple sessions
exist, an error is generated.
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging.
This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
Log messages will be saved into
.Pa tmux-client-PID.log
and
.Pa tmux-server-PID.log
files in the current directory, where
.Em PID
is the pid of the server or client process.
.It Ar command Op Ar arguments
