- window creation/idle time
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)?
- it would be nice to have multichar commands eg C-b K K
- commands:
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history?
- flags to centre screen in window
- better terminal emulation
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- next prev word etc in command prompt
- many more info() displays for various things
- input.c is too complicated. simplify?
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- fix rxvt cursor fg issue (text under cursor can have non-white fg)
- should be able to move to a hidden pane and it would be moved into view. pane
  number in status line/top-right would be cool for this
- support other mouse modes (highlight etc) and use it in copy mode
- set-remain-on-exit is a bit of a hack, some way to do it generically?
- set-option should be set-session-option and should be overall global options
      also quiet, utf8 and maybe other flags?
  -g is a bit unexpected in conf file
- clear window title on exit
- the output code (tty.c) could do with optimisation depending on term
  capabilities
- would be nice to be able to use "--" to mark start of command w/ neww etc
  to avoid quoting
- make command sequences more usable: don't require space after ;, handle
  errors better
- attach should have a flag to create session if it doesn't exist
- choice and more mode would be better per client than per window?
- hooks to which commands may be attached, for example: tmux add-hook
  "new-session" if-shell "[ -e $HOME/.tmux-session.conf ]" source-file
  $HOME/.tmux-session.conf
- get it passing all the vttest tests that don't require resizing the terminal
- esc seq to set window name and title should be documented, and name variant
  should clear automatic-rename
- way to set socket path from config file
- XXX once env stuff is in, default-path and VISUAL/EDITOR should be picked up
  when session is started
- what about utmp etc? can tmux update it like screen? setgid?
- warts on current naming:
  	- display-time but message-fg/bg/attr
	- list-* vs show-*
	- server-info
	- up-pane/down-pane/swap-pane -U/swap-pane -D vs next-*/previous-*
	- split-window -> split-pane??
- tidy up and prioritise todo list ;-)
- neww and attach can create a session if none exists?
       would work fine with config file since
- a way for force-width/height to apply to only one pane (how?)
- command to list what is actually running in each window with command line,
  pid (need some adaption of the osdep code)
- support for bce
- it would be nice if the start/end line keys in copy mode were aware of
  wrapped lines
- some way to force a screen to use the entire terminal even if it is forced
  to be smaller by other clients. pan smaller terminal? (like screen F)
		-- idea of a "view" onto a window, need base x/y offsets
		   for redraw
- handle resize better in copy mode
- way to copy stuff that is off screen due to resize
- commands should be able to succeed or fail and have || or && for command
  lists
- support the mouse wheel to scroll through history
- some way to KEEP a command running continually and just use its LAST line of
  output
- bind commands to mouse buttons
- UTF-8 to a non-UTF-8 terminal should not be able to balls up
  the terminal - www/ruby-addressable; make regress
- copy mode needs a tidy/cleanup
- ability to save history (to buffer?)
- multiple keys could be done with tables, ie have prefixes go and instead
	bind -n ^A prefix-table "default"
  where prefix-table sets command lookup table and sets prefix flag, then next
  key is looked up in that table
- UTF-8 should be a pointer into a combined string buffer
- check irssi (term_charset) works with UTF-8
- support esc-esc to quit in modes
- fix ctrl+F1-F4 output. to what?
- look into xterm clearing its selection when scrolling etc
- better utf8 support:
  	 window names
	 prompt input
	 message display
	 copy and paste cursor and wide characters
	 ...?
- option so that when session is destroyed, attach client to another session
  rather than exiting
- session history for client and last-session command
- option to change status line colour when current window is in a mode?
- option to move copy mode indicator into status line
- list-buffer/show-buffer should display UTF-8
- selection behaviour closer to vi in vi mode
- live update: server started with -U connects to server, requests sessions and
  windows, receives fds
- convert status line history to be server global (anything else?)
- command to show a tree of sessions-windows-panes (active marked with *)
- sort out inheriting config from shell on new sessions/windows:
        should pick up default-path/termios/etc from client if possible,
	else leave empty/default
- define custom layouts
- link panes into multiple windows
- -h option to capture-pane to capture the history as well
- bells should be passed between sessions with visual-bell etc
- use screen-256color when started on 256 colour terminal??
- if-shell/run-shell should block further command execution in the same command
  sequence until its shell exits, to allow them to be used from the config file
- better session sharing: create-socket command to create socket somewhere (-r
  flag for readonly)
- allow buffer to be specified when copying in copy mode
- multiline status line
- flag for absolute pane size to resize-pane
- sanity check input to socket
- select-buffer command
- support title stack, both internally and externally

- copy buffers should be global, limit can be server option, nuke copy-buffer
  command
- command to show status line information briefly when it is off
- some way to pad # stuff with spaces, #!2T maybe
- FreeBSD console problems
- + and - should be more powerful:
	- wrap for windows like panes
	- +2 -2 etc to move by two
- a binding to "scroll down and exit at bottom" copy mode
- some way to pass keystrokes in copy mode through to underlying window
- last window update time and # replacement for it for display-message
- way to define bell etc colours in status line
- find-window across sessions - other ways to make session handling easier?
- ' and " should be parsed the same (eg "\e" vs '\e') in config and command
  prompt?x

For 1.3 (not in order):

3 why are alerts per-winlink? try per window?
4 audit of escape sequence support vs xterm
5 double C-a should walk back over wrapped lines like C-e
6 rectangle copy: when selecting leftward, cursor should be inside block per
  emacs key to rotate corner at which cursor is
8 stdin fd should be passed up to parent so load-buffer and others could use it
  for nonattaching clients
9 something for -t "last window in session" so a session can be used as a stack
10 synchronous commands - client sends cmd and blocks, neww/splitw saves client
   ptr then when program inside died, sends MSG_SOMETHING with wait status to
   client
11 documentation improvements - rlpowell's tutorial
                              - build instructions
12 better configure? with-libevent
13 fix binding multiple keys, C-M-Left C-M-Up etc
14 bind commands to key sequences?
