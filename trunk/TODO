- useful env vars like WINDOW?
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
- line mode/char-at-a-time mode a la telnet?
- handle ioctl/termios stuff on window sockets
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
      backspace should be translated per the termios setting.
      del passed through?
- window creation/idle time
- profile/optimise, particularly (i suspect) input.c
- decide about customised status line
- could use bsearch all over the place or get rid of smaller tables (clientmsg)
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- session with CMD_NOSESSION should be an error
- Implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)
- nested sessions, ie session as window - moving to it moves into session
  (remembering parent)
- Nested sessions over the network, plug-in another tmux as a window/subsession
- it would be nice to have multichar commands so you could have C-b K K for
  kill-window to limit accidental presses
- status-fg/status-bg should be able to set attributes: bold, etc
- save/restore (DECSC/DECRC) are ugly. maybe a struct screen_attr and memcpy
- force maximum terminal size (centred?)
- per-session toolbar state, other options
- force-default option: assume terminal supports default colours even if AX
  is missing (like, eg, xterm-color in an aterm)
- refer to windows by name etc (duplicates? fnmatch?)
- commands:
	kill server
	show-options command
	command to run something without a window at all?
	command to purge window history
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
	paste buffer etc shouldn't be limited to keys
	buffer manip: clear, view etc (clear-buffer, show-buffer)
- function groups, bind-key ^W { select-window 0; send-key ^W } etc ***
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- bind non prefix keys
- stuff like rename would be nice to be able to do in-client like screen, if
  it could be implemented in a non-icky way
- there is too much redrawing. use flags?
- command mode (! + type tmux command)
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history
- audit copy/scroll and other modes for problems with very small windows
- screen_draw_* moved out/renamed (accept TTY_*?)
- get rid of stderr/stdout hacks in log.c
- split clients into three RB trees by fd: attached/unattached/dead?
  or tailqs? what would be fastest per-char?
- multiple paste buffers
- window splitting?
- if only one arg to switch-window, assume source-index
- test on wsvt25, vt100, vt220
- why do up/down work in angband with screen but not tmux??
	-- it's not kkeypad/kcursor
- fix kkeypad/kcursor
- c/p is still borken in some ways
- tobiasu says it is borken on Linux with aterm + TERM=rxvt
- poll(2) is broken on OS X/Darwin, a workaround for this would be nice
- different screen model? layers perhaps? hmm
- cfg file improvements
- proper per-window options (per-session list of window ranges?)

[18:20] *priteau* i found something in tmux that could be tweaked to be better
[18:21] *priteau* in screen, when you type ^A-D, you can actually keep ctrl down
        when typing the D
[18:21] *priteau* in tmux, you have to release ctrl for the command to work
---

-- For 0.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- chmod +x socket when any client is attached (upd in lost/accept)
- clear EOL etc CANNOT rely on term using the current colour/attr and probably
  should not emulate it doing so
- status bar customisation variables, date/time, show-activity, show-last-window
		string-left, string-right - pass through strptime and print...
- show-options
- let server die when last session does
- each command should have a print op as well for list keys
