- key remapping
- decide if TIOCPKT is necessary and either handle it or remove the code
- it would be nice if there wasn't so much copying buffers about, audit uses
- status bar
- useful env vars like WINDOW
- lots of scripting love: add, remove, move around windows, status bar
- sort out who controls the buffers in local.c a bit
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
- scrollback
- server doesn't handle SIGTERM anymore...
- toolbar, copy/paste
- cleanup/redesign IPC
- the whole input/screen/local thing sucks a bit, reorganise/redesign it
- line mode/char-at-a-time mode a la telnet?
- some of the uses of buffers really sucks. buffer_reverse_add/remove,
  and buffer_insert_range/delete_range are abominations. this should be
  rethought
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
- deal properly with ambiguous ops... list-sessions & list-windows
- keys to add:
	NONE?
- commands to add:
	rename sessions
	swap windows
	link/copy windows
	detach session remotely
	create window remotely
	unlink window (... what about windows not linked to any session???)
	close window
	kill session
- update NOTES
- nuke '?' on getopts
- const char *opusage = ... on ops rather than dup usage args
- store_attr/colr could be two-pass and avoid reverse_add/remove games
- window creation/idle time
- attributes could be 8 not 16 bits
- profile/optimise, particularly (i suspect) input.c
- tidy up input.c a bit
- decide about customised status line
