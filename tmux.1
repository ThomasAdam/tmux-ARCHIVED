.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer; it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be
accessed and controlled from a single terminal.
.Pp
.Nm
runs as a server-client system. A server is created automatically when
necessary and holds a number of
.Em sessions ,
each of which may have a number of
.Em windows
linked to it. Any number of
.Em clients
may connect to a session, or the server
may be controlled by issuing commands with
.Nm .
Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl c Ar client-tty
Apply command to the client on the given tty.
Clients may be listed with the
.Ic list-clients
command (see below).
This option does not apply to all commands.
.It Fl S Ar socket-path
Specify an alternative path to the server socket.
The default is
.Pa /tmp/tmux-UID ,
where
.Em UID
is the uid of the user who invoked
.Nm .
.It Fl s Ar session-name
Apply command to the session named
.Ar session-name .
This option does not apply to all commands.
If it is omitted and
.Nm
is invoked from a running
.Nm
client, the session the containing client is connected to will be used;
otherwise, if only one session exists, it is chosen, or if multiple sessions
exist, an error is generated.
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging.
This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
Log messages will be saved into
.Pa tmux-client-PID.log
and
.Pa tmux-server-PID.log
files in the current directory, where
.Em PID
is the pid of the server or client process.
.It Ar command Op Ar arguments
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
.Nm ,
and described in the following sections.
.Pp
.El
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a
prefix, 
.Ql ^B
(ctrl-B) by default, followed by a command key.
.Pp
Some of the default key bindings include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ql d
Detach current client.
.It Ql c
Create new window.
.It Ql n
Change to next window in the current session.
.It Ql p
Change to previous window in the current session.
.It Ql l
Move to last (previously selected) window in the current session.
.It Ql \&?
List current key bindings.
.El
.Pp
A complete list may be obtained with the
.Ic list-keys
command (bound to
.Ql \&? 
by default). Key bindings may be changed with the
.Ic bind-key
and
.Ic unbind-key
commands.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
maintains a configurable history buffer for each window.
By default, up to 2000 lines are kept, this can be altered with the
.Ic history-limit
option (see the
.Ic set-option
command below).
.Sh MODES
A
.Nm
window may be in one of several modes.
The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.
The others are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em output mode
This is entered when a command which produces output, such as
.Ic list-keys ,
is executed from a key binding.
The
.Ql up ,
.Ql down ,
.Ql page-up
and 
.Ql page-down
keys or
.Xr vi 1
style
.Ql j ,
.Ql k ,
keys may be used to scroll the output up and down.
The
.Ql q
key will exit output mode.
.It Em scroll mode
This is entered with the
.Ic scroll-mode
command (bound to
.Ql =
by default) and permits the window history buffer to be inspected.
In addition to the commands supported by output mode, the left and right arrow
keys, or
.Ql h
and
.Ql l ,
will scroll left and right.
.It Em copy mode
This is permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to the
.Em paste buffer
for later insertion into another window.
The navigation keys move the cursor around the window, scrolling as necessary.
The space key begins a selection; the enter key or 
.Ql ^W
copies the selection to the paste buffer and exits copy mode.
.Pp
This mode is entered with the
.Ic copy-mode
command, bound to
.Ql [ 
by default.
