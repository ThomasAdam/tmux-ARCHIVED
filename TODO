- key remapping
- decide if TIOCPKT is necessary and either handle it or remove the code
- it would be nice if there wasn't so much copying buffers about, audit uses
- window names
- status bar
- useful env vars like WINDOW
- lots of scripting love: add, remove, move around windows, status bar
- sort out who controls the buffers in local.c a bit
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
- scrollback
- server doesn't handle SIGTERM anymore...
- sleep(1) to wait for server frankly sucks
- two-way communication (rename) sucks. lose it and use a command line option
  for everythin
- toolbar, copy/paste
- cleanup/redesign IPC
- some of the uses of buffers really sucks. buffer_reverse_add/remove,
  and buffer_insert_range/delete_range are abominations. this should be
  rethought
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
- deal properly with ambiguous ops... list-sessions & list-windows
- split list into list-sessions and list-windows
- command form:
	tmux <flags> cmd [-s session] <flags> data
  eg
	tmux rename-session -ssession newname
	tmux rename-window -ssession 5 newname
  if no session specified:
	- inside tmux, check $TMUX (pid:session or something)
        - otherwise if 1 session, use it
	- otherwise bail with error
