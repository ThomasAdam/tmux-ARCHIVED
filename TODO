- window creation/idle time
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)?
- it would be nice to have multichar commands eg C-b K K
- commands:
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history?
- flags to centre screen in window
- better terminal emulation
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- next prev word etc in command prompt
- many more info() displays for various things
- input.c is too complicated. simplify?
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- fix rxvt cursor fg issue (text under cursor can have non-white fg)
- should be able to move to a hidden pane and it would be moved into view. pane
  number in status line/top-right would be cool for this
- support other mouse modes (highlight etc) and use it in copy mode
- set-remain-on-exit is a bit of a hack, some way to do it generically?
- set-option should be set-session-option and should be overall global options
      also quiet, utf8 and maybe other flags?
  -g is a bit unexpected in conf file
- clear window title on exit
- the output code (tty.c) could do with optimisation depending on term
  capabilities
- would be nice to be able to use "--" to mark start of command w/ neww etc
  to avoid quoting
- make command sequences more usable: don't require space after ;, handle
  errors better
- attach should have a flag to create session if it doesn't exist
- choice and more mode would be better per client than per window?
- hooks to which commands may be attached, for example: tmux add-hook
  "new-session" if-shell "[ -e $HOME/.tmux-session.conf ]" source-file
  $HOME/.tmux-session.conf
- get it passing all the vttest tests that don't require resizing the terminal
- esc seq to set window name and title should be documented, and name variant
  should clear automatic-rename
- way to set socket path from config file
- XXX once env stuff is in, default-path and VISUAL/EDITOR should be picked up
  when session is started
- what about utmp etc? can tmux update it like screen? setgid?
- warts on current naming:
  	- display-time but message-fg/bg/attr
	- list-* vs show-*
	- server-info
	- up-pane/down-pane/swap-pane -U/swap-pane -D vs next-*/previous-*
	- split-window -> split-pane??
- tidy up and prioritise todo list ;-)
- neww and attach can create a session if none exists?
       would work fine with config file since
- a way for force-width/height to apply to only one pane (how?)
- command to list what is actually running in each window with command line,
  pid (need some adaption of the osdep code)
- support for bce
- it would be nice if the start/end line keys in copy mode were aware of
  wrapped lines
- some way to force a screen to use the entire terminal even if it is forced
  to be smaller by other clients. pan smaller terminal? (like screen F)
		-- idea of a "view" onto a window, need base x/y offsets
		   for redraw
- handle resize better in copy mode
- way to copy stuff that is off screen due to resize
- a way to address panes by name ("top-left") and position ("0,0")
- commands should be able to succeed or fail and have || or && for command
  lists
- support the mouse wheel to scroll through history
- some way to KEEP a command running continually and just use its LAST line of
  output
- bind commands to mouse buttons
- UTF-8 to a non-UTF-8 terminal should not be able to balls up
  the terminal - www/ruby-addressable; make regress
- copy mode needs a tidy/cleanup
- an option to NOT remove message when key pressed
- the wrapping stuff should work when redrawn from scroll mode too (screen_write_copy)
- ability to save history (to buffer?)
- multiple keys could be done with tables, ie have prefixes go and instead
	bind -n ^A prefix-table "default"
  where prefix-table sets command lookup table and sets prefix flag, then next key
  is looked up in that table
- check fix UTF-8 and split-window? should be okay
- UTF-8 should be a pointer into a combined string buffer
- check irssi (term_charset) works with UTF-8
- rectangle copy/paste
- support esc-esc to quit in modes
- fix ctrl+F1-F4 output. to what?
- look into xterm clearing its selection when scrolling etc
- better utf8 support:
  	 window names
	 prompt input
	 message display
	 copy and paste cursor and wide characters
	 ...?
- would prompt history/message log be better as server-global? need server global options
- don't require mouse/xterm input to be atomic
- option so that when session is destroyed, attach client to another session rather than exiting
