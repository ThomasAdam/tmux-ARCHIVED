- window creation/idle time
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)?
- it would be nice to have multichar commands eg C-b K K
- commands:
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history?
- better mode features: search
- flags to centre screen in window
- better terminal emulation
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- next prev word etc in command prompt; also ^K
- many more info() displays for various things
- backspace should perhaps wrap backwards over newlines which were not moved
  down by a newline: screen and the OS X terminal does this but xterm and most
  others do not. this might be hard: a flag for each grid line (top bit of size
  maybe)? a single flag is insufficient as can't then tell when to /stop/
  unwrapping
- input.c is too complicated. simplify?
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- kill all but current pane
- fix rxvt cursor fg issue (text under cursor can have non-white fg)
- client sx/sy should be in tty, then can let the terminal wrap at edge
  to allow xterm to pick up it should be one line for its c/p
- should be able to move to a hidden pane and it would be moved into view. pane
  number in status line/top-right would be cool for this
- support other mouse modes (highlight etc) and use it in copy mode
- set-remain-on-exit is a bit of a hack, some way to do it generically?
- set-option should be set-session-option and should be overall global options
  for stuff like mode keys?
      also quiet, utf8 and maybe other flags?
  -g is a bit unexpected in conf file
- clear window title on exit
- the output code (tty.c) could do with optimisation depending on term
  capibilities
- would be nice to be able to use "--" to mark start of command w/ neww etc
  to avoid quoting
- goto line and search history in copy/scroll modes
- clone session command
- make command sequences more usable: don't require space after ;, handle
  errors better
- key to switch to copy mode from scroll mode
- attach should have a flag to create session if it doesn't exist
- a way to address panes by name ("top-left") and position ("0,0")
- rename split-window -> split-pane??
- fix UTF-8 guesswork on sparc64, improve tty checks
- choice and more mode would be better per client than per window?
- hooks to which commands may be attached, for example: tmux add-hook
  "new-session" if-shell "[ -e $HOME/.tmux-session.conf ]" source-file
  $HOME/.tmux-session.conf
- get it passing all the vttest tests that don't require resizing the terminal
- esc seq to set window title should be documented and should set
  automatic-rename
- way to set socket path from config file
- XXX once env stuff is in, default-path and VISUAL/EDITOR should be picked up
  when session is started
- when moving up from a blank line in copy mode it always assumes you were at
  the end of the line so it can be a bit funny. should remember last non-blank
  x position and use that
- paste-buffer etc should be able to handle \0, so needs a size member and no
  more strlen
- what about utmp etc? can tmux update it like screen? setgid?
- H/M/L commands in copy mode with vi-keys, for jumping to the top/middle/last
  line on the screen
- split list-windows into separate list-windows and list-panes
- warts on current naming:
  	- display-time but message-fg/bg/attr
	- list-* vs show-*
	- server-info
	- up-pane/down-pane/swap-pane -U/swap-pane -D vs next-*/previous-*
- pcvt25 doesn't work properly, why? (bce?)
- tidy up and prioritise todo list ;-)
- it is only possible to specify 8 colours to fg/bg options; should be able to
  set 256 as well
- neww and attach can create a session if none exists?
       would work fine with config file since
- option to set customisable prompt for command-prompt (so eg bind -n F2
  command-prompt "splitw 'exec man %%') can have "man: " instead of "(splitw)".
- a way for force-width/height to apply to only one pane (how?)
- **** a command to run something without a window and send any output to the
  window-more. if no output, info() a line saying "'%s' returned %d". so i can
  bind mpc control commands to function keys ;-)
- command to list what is actually running in each window with command line,
  pid (need some adaption of the osdep code)
- string option to change/remove the symbols (*-+ etc) in status line
- support for bce
- it would be nice if the start/end line keys in copy mode were aware of
  wrapped lines
- per session locking
- some way to force a screen to use the entire terminal even if it is forced
  to be smaller by other clients. pan smaller terminal? (like screen F)
		-- idea of a "view" onto a window, need base x/y offsets
		   for redraw
- stuff should be pane targets rather than window targets:
       	 - send-keys/send-prefix
	 - all the mode stuff
- a window option which means data is echoed to all panes in a window
- support running tmux from inside tmux [#(), if-shell] --
  	  generic system-like function which may take a callback
	  also sets up environment (TMUX) and has a timeout
- handle resize better in copy mode
- way to copy stuff that is off screen due to resize
