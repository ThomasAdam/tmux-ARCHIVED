- useful env vars like WINDOW?
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
- line mode/char-at-a-time mode a la telnet?
- handle ioctl/termios stuff on window sockets
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
      backspace should be translated per the termios setting.
      del passed through?
- window creation/idle time
- profile/optimise, particularly (i suspect) input.c
- decide about customised status line
- could use bsearch all over the place or get rid of smaller tables (clientmsg)
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- commands should have to care less about CMD_KEY
- session with CMD_NOSESSION should be an error
- each command should have a print op as well for list keys
- Implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)
- nested sessions, ie session as window - moving to it moves into session
  (remembering parent)
- Nested sessions over the network, plug-in another tmux as a window/subsession
- it would be nice to have multichar commands so you could have C-b K K for
  kill-window to limit accidental presses
- status-fg/status-bg should be able to set attributes: bold, etc
- save/restore (DECSC/DECRC) are ugly. maybe a struct screen_attr and memcpy
- force maximum terminal size (centred?)
- per-session toolbar state, other options
- force-default option: assume terminal supports default colours even if AX
  is missing (like, eg, xterm-color in an aterm)
- refer to windows by name etc (duplicates? fnmatch?)
- commands:
	start server
	kill server
	show-options command
	command to run something without a window at all?
	command to insert a key (or other data...) into a window (send-key)
		should paste-buffer become send-buffer.....
	command to purge window history
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
	paste buffer etc shouldn't be limited to keys
	buffer manip: clear, view etc
- function groups, bind-key ^W { select-window 0; send-key ^W } etc
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- session specification is all over the place. some things use -s before cmd,
  some -s after, some no -s, there are various uses of -n. the differences are
  sort of logical, but confusing. needs rethought
- XXX should -i for win idx be before cmd too??
- bind non prefix keys
- stuff like rename would be nice to be able to do in-client like screen, if
  it could be implemented in a non-icky way
- there is to much redrawing. use flags?
- command mode (! + type tmux command)
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history
- audit copy/scroll and other modes for problems with very small windows
- screen_draw_* moved out/renamed (accept TTY_*?)
- get rid of stderr/stdout hacks in log.c

-- For 0.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- window splitting?
- restore term cap checks
- anything which uses cmd_{send,recv}_string will break if the string is
  split. string length should be part of the command size
- echo \\033[35\;46m\\033[2J last line quirk (with C-b r)

         * The low two bits of Cb encode button information: 0=MB1
