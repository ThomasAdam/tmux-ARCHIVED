Command prefix is C-b. This can be changed by building with, for example:

    META='\001' make

Key bindings:
    d detach
    c create new window
    n next window
    p previous window
    l last (next to last selected) window
    ? list current key bindings
    0-9 select window

There is one default server process per user which puts its socket in
/tmp/tmux-UID. It is created the first time tmux is run and subsequent
invocations will connect to the same server. The server holds multiple
sessions.

Syntax is: tmux [-v] [-S path] [-s sessioon] command [flags]

    -v Create logfiles, verbosity increases with more -v
    -S Set different server socket path
    -s Specify session name for command, if appropriate.

If a session name is not given, the current session is assumed if a command
is run from inside tmux and the TMUX environment variable is available,
otherwise if only one exists, it is used or if multiple exist, an error is
generated.

Commands:
    (Commands can be shortened, as long as they are unambiguous)

    new-session [-d] [-s session name] [-n window name] [command]
        Create new session. Attaches to new session unless -d is given.

    attach-session [-d]
        Attach to session. Detaches other clients if -d is given.

    list-sessions
        List sessions (can be shortened to ls).

    list-windows
        List windows (can be shortened to lsw).

    rename-window [-i <window index>] new name
        Rename window.

    bind-key key command

    list-keys

    unbind-key key
