Command prefix is C-b. This can be changed by building with, for example:

    META='\001' make

Keybindings:
    d detach
    c create new window
    n next window
    p previous window
    l last (next to last selected) window
    r refresh screen
    w list current windows
    i show window info
    0-9 select window

There is one default server process per user which puts its socket in
/tmp/tmux-UID. It is created the first time tmux is run and subsequent
invocations will connect to the same server. The server holds multiple
sessions.

Syntax is: tmux [-v] [-S path] command [flags]

    -v Create logfiles, verbosity increases with more -v
    -S Set different server socket path

Commands:
    (Commands can be shortened, as long as they are unambigous)

    new-session [-s <session name>] [-d]
        Create new session. Attaches to new session unless -d is given.

    attach [-s <session name>] 
        Attach to session.

    list-sessions
        List sessions (can be shortened to ls).

    list-windows [-s <session name>]
        List windows (can be shortened to lsw).

    rename-window [-s <session name>] [-i <window index>] name
        Rename window.

Sessions are destroyed when no windows remain attached to them.

You might get message "couldn't find server" after a crash, in this case you
must remove the /tmp/tmux-`id -u` file manually.
